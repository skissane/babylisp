ACT 1 - JAVA PROTOTYPE WITH TREE-BASED EVALUATION

1] Use tree-based evaluator in Java
2] Get (as close to feasible) 100% code coverage
	- Write tests in BabyLisp not Java

ACT 2 - JAVA PROTOTYPE WITH BYTECODE VM

3] Introduce a bytecode VM and compiler
4] Replace tree-based evaluator with bytecode compiler/VM

ACT 3 - BEGINNINGS OF C IMPLEMENTATION

5] Create SystemLisp->C compiler
	- SystemLisp: Lisp-like syntax, C-like semantics
6] Begin writing new implementation in SystemLisp

ACT 4 - FINISH C IMPLEMENTATION

7] 100% test coverage for SystemLisp implementation
8] Remove the old Java implementation
