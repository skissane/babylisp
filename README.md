Toy language which resembles Lisp

There is no attempt to follow any particular existing Lisp dialect. This is just a language which vaguely resembles Lisp.

Two main reasons for creating this:
* Just as a learning exercise
* I have some ideas about memory management I want to explore

On the second point, instead of garbage collection, I intend to use a form of handle-based memory management.

# Plan

I plan to create two iterations:
* First iteration will be written in Java
* Second iteration will be written in C

The first iteration won't really demonstrate the memory management ideas since of course Java has automated
memory management with garbage collection.
